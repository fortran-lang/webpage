#~ " the rules for every detail of your"

#~ " ``Makefile`` and would they be able "
#~ "to debug or add features?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Pure ``make`` will not scale. You will"
#~ " soon add auxiliary programs to "
#~ "dynamically or statically generate your "
#~ "``Makefile``. Those introduce dependencies and "
#~ "possible sources of errors. The effort "
#~ "needed to test and document those "
#~ "tools should not be underestimated."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If you think ``make`` is suitable for"
#~ " your needs, than you can start "
#~ "writing your ``Makefile``. For this course"
#~ " we will use real world examples "
#~ "from the package index, which (at the"
#~ " time of writing) use build systems "

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The main drawback of ``make`` for "

#~ "Some compilers (like the Intel Fortran "
#~ "compiler) also offer to generate "
#~ "dependencies in ``make`` format."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Before diving into the dependency "
#~ "generation, we will outline the concept "
#~ "of a robust take on the dependency "
#~ "problem. First, we want an approach "
#~ "that can process all source files "
#~ "independently, while each source file "
#~ "provides (``module``) or requires (``use``) "
#~ "modules. When generating the dependencies "
#~ "only the name of the source file "
#~ "and the module files are known, and"
#~ " no information on the object file "
#~ "names should be required."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Note the declaration of ``obj`` as "
#~ "recursively expanded variable, we effectively "
#~ "use this mechanism to define a "
#~ "function in ``make``. The ``foreach`` "
#~ "function allows us to loop over all"
#~ " source files, while the ``eval`` "
#~ "function allows us to generate ``make`` "
#~ "statements and evaluate them for this "
#~ "``Makefile``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "To generate the respective dependency map"
#~ " automatically we will use an ``awk`` "
#~ "script here"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The above script uses the ``awk`` "
#~ "language, which is designed for the "
#~ "purpose of text stream processing and "
#~ "uses a C-like syntax. In ``awk`` you"
#~ " can define groups which are evaluated"
#~ " on certain events, *e.g.* when a "
#~ "line matches a specific pattern, usually "
#~ "expressed by a <a "
#~ "href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\" "
#~ "target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> regular "
#~ "expression</a>."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This ``awk`` script defines five groups, "
#~ "two of them use the special pattern"
#~ " ``BEGIN`` and ``END`` which are run "
#~ "before the script starts and after the"
#~ " script finishes, respectively. Before the "
#~ "script starts we make the script "
#~ "case-insensitive since we are dealing "
#~ "with Fortran source code here. We also"
#~ " use the special variable ``FILENAME`` to"
#~ " determine which file we are currently"
#~ " parsing and to allow processing multiple"
#~ " files at once."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "With the three patterns defined we are"
#~ " looking for ``module``, ``use`` and "

#~ " parsed correctly. A failing example "
#~ "would be:"

#~ "In theory you would need a full "

#~ "lines and other difficulties. This might "

#~ "but would require a huge script in "
#~ "the end."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Make the script executable (``chmod +x "
#~ "gen-deps.awk``) and test it with "
#~ "``./gen-deps.awk $(find src -name "
#~ "'*.[fF]90')``. You should see output like"
#~ " this:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Note that the scripts output will use"
#~ " recursively expanded variables and not "
#~ "define any dependencies yet, because out-"

#~ "to create any target by accident. You"
#~ " can verify that the same information "
#~ "as in the above handwritten snippet is"
#~ " present. The only exception is the "
#~ "additional dependency on the "
#~ "``iso_fortran_env.mod``, since it is an "
#~ "undefined variable it will just expand "
#~ "to an empty string and not introduce"
#~ " any further dependencies."

#~ "Now, you can finally include this "

#~ "the dependency generation:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Here additional dependency files are "
#~ "generated for each source file individually"
#~ " and than included into the main "
#~ "``Makefile``. Also, the dependency files are"
#~ " added as dependency to the object "
#~ "files to ensure they are generated "
#~ "before the object is compiled. The "
#~ "pipe character in the dependencies defines"
#~ " an order of the rules without a"
#~ " timestamp dependency, because it is not"
#~ " necessary to recompile an object file"
#~ " in case dependencies are regenerated and"
#~ " potentially unchanged."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Again, we make use of the ``eval`` "
#~ "function to generate the dependencies in "
#~ "a ``foreach`` loop over all object "

#~ "between the object files in the "
#~ "dependency files, expanding ``dep`` once "
