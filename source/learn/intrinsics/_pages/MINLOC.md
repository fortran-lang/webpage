## minloc

### **Name**

**minloc**(3) - \[ARRAY:LOCATION\] Location of the minimum value within an array

### **Syntax**

```fortran
    result = minloc(array, dim, mask)
```

or

```fortran
    result = minloc(array, mask)
```

### **Description**

Determines the location of the element in the array with the minimum
value, or, if the **dim** argument is supplied, determines the locations of
the minimum element along each row of the array in the **dim** direction. If
**mask** is present, only the elements for which **mask** is **.true.** are
considered. If more than one element in the array has the minimum value,
the location returned is that of the first such element in array element
order. If the array has zero size, or all of the elements of **mask** are
.false., then the result is an array of zeroes. Similarly, if **dim** is
supplied and all of the elements of **mask** along a given row are zero, the
result value for that row is zero.

### **Arguments**

- **array**
  : Shall be an array of type _integer_, _real_, or _character_.

- **dim**
  : (Optional) Shall be a scalar of type _integer_, with a value between
  one and the rank of **array**, inclusive. It may not be an optional
  dummy argument.

- **mask**
  : Shall be an array of type _logical_, and conformable with **array**.

### **Returns**

If **dim** is absent, the result is a rank-one array with a length equal to
the rank of **array**. If **dim** is present, the result is an array with a rank
one less than the rank of **array**, and a size corresponding to the size of
**array** with the **dim** dimension removed. If **dim** is present and **array** has a
rank of one, the result is a scalar. In all cases, the result is of
default _integer_ type.

### **Examples**

sample program:

```fortran
program demo_minloc
implicit none
integer,save :: ints(3,5)= reshape([&
   4, 10,  1,  7, 13, &
   9, 15,  6, 12,  3, &
  14,  5, 11,  2,  8  &
],shape(ints),order=[2,1])
    write(*,*) minloc(ints)
    write(*,*) minloc(ints,dim=1)
    write(*,*) minloc(ints,dim=2)
    ! where in each column is the smallest number .gt. 10 ?
    write(*,*) minloc(ints,dim=2,mask=ints.gt.10)
    ! a one-dimensional array with dim=1 explicitly listed returns a scalar
    write(*,*) minloc(pack(ints,.true.),dim=1) ! scalar
end program demo_minloc
```

Results:

```text
         1       3
         1       3       1       3       2
         3       5       4
         5       4       3
         7
```
