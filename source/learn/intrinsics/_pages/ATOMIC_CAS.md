## atomic_cas

### **Name**

**atomic_cas**(3) - \[ATOMIC\] Atomic compare and swap

### **Syntax**

```fortran
call atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new, stat)
```

### **Description**

atomic_cas compares the variable **atom** with the value of **compare**; if the
value is the same, **atom** is set to the value of **new**. Additionally, **old** is
set to the value of **atom** that was used for the comparison. When **stat** is
present and the invocation was successful, it is assigned the value 0.
If it is present and the invocation has failed, it is assigned a
positive value; in particular, for a coindexed **atom**, if the remote image
has stopped, it is assigned the value of iso_fortran_env's
stat_stopped_image and if the remote image has failed, the value
stat_failed_image.

### **Arguments**

- **atom**
  : Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of either integer type with
  atomic_int_kind kind or logical type with atomic_logical_kind
  kind.

- **old**
  : Scalar of the same type and kind as **atom**.

- **compare**
  : Scalar variable of the same type and kind as **atom**.

- **new**
  : Scalar variable of the same type as **atom**. If kind is different, the
  value is converted to the kind of **atom**.

- **stat**
  : (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_atomic_cas
use iso_fortran_env
implicit none
logical(atomic_logical_kind) :: atom[*], prev
   call atomic_cas(atom[1], prev, .false., .true.)
end program demo_atomic_cas
```
