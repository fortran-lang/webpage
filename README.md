## Setup

### Build fortran-lang.org site (Sphinx Version)

This assumes that you already have a recent version of python
For example on Ubuntu 20.04, do:

To install the dependencies of this project, use commamd:

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Build the site by invoking

```
make dirhtml
```

The website will be built in `build/html` and can be previewed by starting a webserver and opening the page with a browser (*e.g.* firefox, chromium or similar):

```
python -m http.server -d build/html
```

By default all languages will be built.
To limit the build to a single language subtree, *i.e.* English, use

```
make dirhtml LANGUAGES=en
```

After adding a new entry to package index, run the github action *fortran\_packages* before building the sphinx build.

### Activating the pre-commit hooks for Black and Pylint:

This assumes that you already have a cloned the main branch of this repository.
Steps to activate the pre-commit hooks are:
1. Make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of the repository.
```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```
2. Activate the pre-commit hooks:
```
pre-commit install
```
Now, the precommit hooks have been successfully been installed into your clone.

#### Steps to debug/resolve issues which prevent the commit due to pre-commit hooks:

1. if pylint causes the issues in commiting to the repo, and it seems mandatory to `skip`
the pre-commit hooks use: 

```
SKIP=pylint git commit -m"my commit"` 
```
2. if black causes the issues in commiting to the repo, and it seems mandatory to `skip`
the pre-commit hooks use: 

```
SKIP=black git commit -m"my commit"
```
### Translating via weblate

Translations can be contributed via [weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fortran-lang/webpage/).

[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/fortran-lang/-/webpage/horizontal-auto.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/fortran-lang/)


### Update or add translations

The documentation uses the
[sphinx-intl](https://sphinx-intl.readthedocs.io/en/master/quickstart.html)
utility to generate websites for multiple languages.
It generates `*.po` files,
which contain the original sentences and a placeholder for translations.

To update translations run

```
make gettext
```

if you only want to update a single translation add `LANGUAGES=de` to the command.
This command will generate the message catalog (`*.pot`) and update the `*.po` files in the *locale* directory of the respective translations.
Then edit the `*.po` files,
e.g. `locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/index.po`.
In the `*.po` files are paragraphs like
```po
#: ../../pages/index.md:16
msgid "Package manager and build system for Fortran"
msgstr ""
```

The first line describes the file and line where to find the original text.

The second line is the original text.
**Don't edit this line, edit the original document instead**.

The third line is meant for the translation.

To continue a long string in another line,
simply close the string in the current line with `"`
and open another one in the line underneath. E.g.
```po
msgstr "This is "
"one string"
```
*don't forget a space between 'is' and 'one'*

After adding or updating translations
build the documentation as described above.
